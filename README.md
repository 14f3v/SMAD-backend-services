# hyperscale-application-showcase

## Description:

    - This project serves as a showcase for building scalable real-time applications using modern technologies. The serverside application is powered by bun.sh runtime and Socket.IO for efficient real-time communication. Redis is integrated to manage connection pools, enabling the system to handle millions of concurrent connections.

    - The frontend application, developed with ReactJS and Socket.IO, facilitates interaction with the server via WebSocket protocols, ensuring seamless communication between clients and servers.


## Purpose:

    The purpose of this project is to provide developers with insights into system architecture scalability, multiplexing protocols, and the importance of horizontal scaling in real-time applications.
